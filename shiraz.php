            <p>Shiraz  is the fifth-most-populous city of Iran and the capital of Fars Province also known as Pars and Persis ( <a href="persia.php">Persia</a> ). Shiraz is located in the southwest of Iran on the "Rudkhaneye Khoshk" (The Dry River) seasonal river. It has a moderate climate and has been a regional trade center for over a thousand years. Shiraz is one of the oldest cities of ancient Persia. It was the capital of Persia during the Zand dynasty from 1750 until 1800. Two famous poets of Iran, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez" target="_blank">Hafez</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadi_Shirazi" target="_blank">Saadi</a> are from Shiraz, whose tombs are on the north side of the current city boundaries.</p>
            <p>Shiraz is known as the city of poets, literature, flowers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz_wine" target="_blank">wine</a> (despite Iran being an Islamic republic since 1979). It is also considered by many Iranians to be the city of gardens, due to the many gardens and fruit trees that can be seen in the city, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eram_Garden" target="_blank" >Eram Garden</a>. Shiraz has had major Jewish and Christian communities. The crafts of Shiraz consist of inlaid mosaic work of triangular design; silver-ware; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knotted-pile_carpet" target="_blank">pile carpet-weaving</a> and weaving of kilim, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilim" target="_blank"></a> and jajim in the villages and among the tribes. In Shiraz industries such as cement production, sugar, fertilizers, textile products, wood products, metalwork, and rugs dominate. ShirƒÅz also has a major <a href="http://www.pogdc.com/en/portfolio/me/shirazoilrefinery" target="_blank">oil refinery</a> and is a major center for Iran's electronic industries: 53% of Iran's electronic investment has been centered in Shiraz. Shiraz is home to Iran's first solar power plant. Recently the city's first wind turbine has been installed above Babakuhi mountain near the city. </p>
